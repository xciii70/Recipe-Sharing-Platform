# Recipe-Sharing-Platform

## Project Description
This project is a lightweight, community-driven web application designed for sharing home recipes. Built entirely using **native PHP** without any external frameworks, the system focuses heavily on fundamental web structures, server-side rendering (SSR), and secure CRUD manipulation to strictly limit client-side scripting. 

The application is specifically optimized to run efficiently on a hardware-constrained **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** environment using link-local networking (WiFi WAN off for demo). It implements an integrated in-app page for member introductions and a streamlined **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** relational database structure (MariaDB/PostgreSQL) optimized for low memory overhead.

## Tech Stack & Runtime
- **Hardware Platform:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- **Web Server:** HTTP Server (Apache/Nginx)
- **Backend Scripting:** Native PHP Engine (Server-Side Rendering)
- **Database:** MariaDB / PostgreSQL (3NF Schema, `utf8mb4` encoding)
- **Network Configuration:** Link-local networking (WiFi off for demo)
